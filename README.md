# tic-tac-toe
This Python code generates a tic tac toe game that uses numbers as place holders. The number chosen is immediately changed to either x or o depending on the turn to play, and it can also handle errors in which the number chosen is not in the range of numbers chosen or the number chosen is occupied.
